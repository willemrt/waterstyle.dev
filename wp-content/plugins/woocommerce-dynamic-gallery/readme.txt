= 1.1.8 - 2013/04/26 =
* Feature - Reduction in memory used when loading images to the gallery in the edit product page Dynamic Gallery image uploader. We have made several tweaks to the output buffering function to achieve this. Particularly useful for those with servers running low on or operating on low memory resources.
* Tweak - Added when install and activate plugin link redirects to WooCommerce Dynamic Gallery admin panel instead of the wp-plugins dashboard.

= 1.1.7 - 2013/04/10 =
* Fix - WooCommerce Reviews form opening in duplicate popup tools, PrettyPhoto and Fancybox caused by our old WooCommerce v1.6 fancybox lib.

= 1.1.6 - 2013/04/04 =
* Fix - Long standing issue with Gallery main image not showing in bespoke themes in Windows 7 and Widows 8 with IE browsers 8.0, 9.0, 10.0 and 10.0 Desktop. Many thanks to Nemanja from the Art Binaire Team for providing the solution.
* Tweak - The above fixed allowed us to complete full Gallery Optimization in Windows XP, IE 7, IE8, Windows 7, IE8 and IE9 and Windows 8, IE10 and IE10 Desktop.
* Tweak - Full Gallery test and optimization for  all 3 Windows operating systems - for these legacy browsers - Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Opera.

= 1.1.5 - 2013/03/25 =
* Fix - Lightbox pop-up script bug. When using the Lightbox tool for the image pop-up the current image did not show - instead showed first image in the gallery. Could never resolve this so we have replaced the old Lightbox pop-up script with new Colorbox script. This fixes this long standing issue.
* Fix - Bug for users who have https: (SSL) on their sites wp-admin but have http on sites front end. This was causing a -1 to show in the Gallery Container instead of the current image because wp-admin with SSL applied only allows https:, but the url of admin-ajax.php is http: and it is denied hence returning the ajax -1 error. Fixed by writing a filter to recognize when https is configured on wp-admin and parsing correctly. If you do not have this configuration nothing changes for you, if you do have https on your wp-admin (or install it in the future) and http on the front end then Dynamic Gallery will automatically detect that and works as it should.

= 1.1.4 - 2013/03/09 =
* Feature - UI Enhancement. Complete rework of the admin dashboard.
* Tweak - Admin panel content broken up into sub nav tabs for ease of feature management. Gallery | Global Settings | Caption text | Nav Bar | Lazy-load scroll | Image Thumbnails
* Tweak - Added WooCommerce Chosen script for dropdowns and options.
* Fix - Undefined PrettyPhoto script include. Defined script to load from footer after jQuery script. In some sites this was causing the image Zoom not to work.
* Fix - Conflict with Chrome browser add on AdBlocker. Chrome extension Adblocker was hiding the gallery class name a3dg-images which was causing the main gallery images not to show. Edited style so now gallery shows with that add-on activated.
* Docs - Updated plugins wiki documentation to show the new admin UI and features

= 1.1.3 - 2013/03/04 =
* Feature - Updated all plugin code to be 100% compatible with WooCommerce V2.0 and backwards.
* Feature - Added new WordPress and WooCommerce PrettyPhoto tool and made it the default pop up tool for the gallery. NOTE: You must have upgraded WordPress to Version 3.5+ for the PrettyPhoto pop-up to work. If you have not upgraded to WordPress 3.5 do not install this plugin upgrade until you do or the image pop-up won't work for you. Note WooCommerce 2.0 requires WordPress 3.5.
* Feature - On install Dynamic Gallery can now show product feature images that have been created from the WordPress Media Library. Previously the gallery could not find these images and would show no image.
* Feature - Added delete WordPress Media Library Featured image from the Dynamic Gallery Product Page Meta. The Media Library thumbnail has a Red X on it and pop up on hover text to explain why users should delete the image and upload it to the Dynamic gallery.

* Tweak - Added Thumbnail help text on admin panel, warning not to set the Thumbnail width and height to '0' empty as it causes a .php error 'not divisible by zero'  message to show on product pages instead of the Gallery.

= 1.0.8 - 2013/01/09 =
* Tweak - Updated Support and Pro Version link URL's on wordpress.org description, plugins and plugins dashboard. Links were returning 404 errors since the launch of the all new a3rev.com mobile responsive site as the base e-commerce permalinks is changed.

= 1.0.7 - 2012/11/23 =
* Tweak - Dynamic Gallery now only recognizes image formats .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .png. It won't recognize another file and won't show in gallery, or on Image gallery manager meta box. Mean that files like PDF's can be uploaded and the gallery does not show them or on the Pro version create variations for them in the pop up image manager.
* Tweak - Added link to Dynamic gallery Admin tab for our New WordPress version of WooCommerce Product Widget Slideshow plugin.
* Tweak - Added 'Apply to All' option on Gallery Image manager pop-up - this feature allows PRO Version user to Apply all variations in a set to the selected image with one click - Thanks to Shawn for the feedback and the idea.

= 1.0.5 - 2012/10/26 =

* Fix - Caption text pop-up now sync with and set by the Time between transitions settings (Lite and Pro Versions).

* Tweak - Update dashboard to show new Pro version features - responsive setting and include product variation images.
* Tweak - Added Pro Version check box features for deactivate gallery and variation images to product page gallery manager.

= 1.0.3 - 2012/09/03 =
* Feature - Add fancybox script to plugin so that if the theme does not support fancybox or it is disabled in the admin panel then the gallery image zoom can still work.
* Fix - Gallery preview not working on sites that do not have wp_enqueue_script( 'thickbox' ) by default. Added call to wp_enqueue_script( 'thickbox' ) if it does not exist so that preview window can open.
* Fix - Updated depreciated php function ereg() with stristr() so that Pro version auto plugin auto upgrade feature work without error for WordPress 3.4.0 and later
* Tweak - Enqueue plugin script into footer use wp_enqueue_script so that now it is only loaded when needed rather than site-wide and has zero impact on page load speeds.
